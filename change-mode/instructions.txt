Use a change-mode file.

Torrc in default restores the default mode if was changed. It uses a random exit IP chosen by Tor itself, so it will never die.
If Tor still died, middles need to be replaced, they are providing at least some stability in terms of speed and are not randomized, being old and stable enough.

Replace your original torrc.txt with pro torrc to enable pro mode. By default Tor is selecting a completely random IP to be used as an exit node, which may trigger protections.
Using one exit for everyone will again trigger those protections, and is also not stable if exit dies. Selecting an exit is a preferable behavior for a skilled Tor user.
Check protections on these two YouTube videos.
